### Features Left to Implement

- Banner with locations and time at the bottom of every page about footer

## Testing 

Widnes Climbers was built for mobile screen sizes and then tested to see how it expands to fill a window with every meaningful change. This was done using the inspect feature mostly

It was important the navigation is always accessible on every screen size.

The presentation of text on pages was found to be difficult to read.
This was fixed by making text boxes bigger and away from images to make reading easier.

The background was found to be too distracting in testing & was made to have a higher opacity.

The footer was found to overlap content or cover the entire page. This was fixed with code from developer.mozilla.org (see credits, 'Footer-credit')

Each pages navigation is able to navigate to all pages. tested with use.
