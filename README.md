# Widnes Climbers

Widnes Climbers is a site to help people in Widnes come together and go climbing together in the surrounding area, inside and outside. Its aim is for climbers of Widnes to have an easy place to join the group and know where people are. The site will target new and experienced climbers who would like company while they climb or just want to get into the sport and need encouragement.

Widnes Climbers will explain the different types of climbing the group does and when they meet. It will also have a sign up newsletter with questions about what type of climbing the visitor is interested in, so they can be informed on when and where that type is and be notified of changes.

## Testing 

Widnes Climbers was built for mobile screen sizes and then tested to see how it expands to fill a window with every meaningful change. This was done by dragging a browser window to see the changes happen.

It is important the navigation is always accessible on every screen size.

The footer was found to overlap content or cover the entire page. This was fixed with code from developer.mozilla.org (see credits, 'Footer-credit')

Each pages navigation is able to navigate to all pages.


------
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
